[The project](https://github.com/vitalliuss/helloci/tree/master/Java) I was using.

There're the steps to unpack my project: 

* git clone Maven-Fundamentals

* unzip the file inside the project

## Other
 
All the materials were taken from the [EPAM Automated Testing course](https://training.epam.com/#!/Training/3044?lang=en). :test_tube:

The backup of the tasks could be found [there](https://github.com/vitalliuss/automation-training.git), in file "backup.md". :file_folder:

Unfortunately they provided only RU verion of the requirements.
